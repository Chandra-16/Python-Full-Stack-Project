Project Title: 
Micro-Productivity Experiment Tracker
This project helps users run small, personal "experiments" on their productivity. For example, "Does listening to classical music while working improve my focus?" Users would log their focus levels and music type, and the app would visualize the results.

Database: Stores experiment logs, variables (e.g., music type, time of day), and outcomes (e.g., focus level on a scale of 1-10).

Backend: An API to log data points for each experiment.

Visualizations: A scatter plot or a bar chart to compare productivity levels under different conditions.


Home Energy Usage Breakdown
EnergyFlo is a powerful and intuitive financial tool designed to transform the way homeowners manage their energy consumption. By leveraging a robust Python backend and a secure Supabase database, the application goes beyond simple utility bill tracking. It provides a granular, real-time breakdown of energy usage on an appliance-by-appliance basis.

With EnergyFlo, users can pinpoint which devices are consuming the most power and visualize their usage trends over time. The platform's dynamic dashboard presents this complex data in clear, easy-to-understand charts and graphs, enabling homeowners to identify inefficient habits, implement smarter practices, and ultimately reduce both their utility bills and their environmental footprint. EnergyFlo empowers users with the insights they need to make data-driven decisions for a more efficient and sustainable home.

Database: Stores energy consumption data by appliance and time period.

Backend: An API to receive data inputs and perform calculations.

Visualizations: A detailed pie chart showing energy consumption by appliance, and a line chart to show usage trends over different months.
